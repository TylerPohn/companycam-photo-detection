# ML Models

This directory contains machine learning models and training scripts for photo detection and classification.

## Structure

- `models/` - Trained model files and configurations
  - Saved model weights
  - Model architectures
  - Preprocessing pipelines

- `training/` - Training scripts and datasets
  - Model training code
  - Data preprocessing
  - Evaluation scripts
  - Training notebooks

## Models

TBD - Will contain models for:
- Photo quality detection
- Object detection in construction photos
- Image classification

## Requirements

See `requirements.txt` for ML dependencies (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.)
